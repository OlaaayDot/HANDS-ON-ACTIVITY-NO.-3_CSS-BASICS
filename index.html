                <h2>Childhood</h2>
                <p>When I was a child I usually just play computer
                    games with my family because I got nothing to do.
                    I dreamt of being a game developer because I was
                    attracted to a game called "Minecraft".
                </p>

                <h2>Teenage Life</h2>
                <p>My teenage life consist of too much addiction of
                    playing online computer games. Especially with
                    pandemic, I played all throughout the day from
                    6:00 A.M in the morning to 3:00 AM in the morning.
                    I got no sympathy for myself.

                <h2>Adulthood</h2>
                <p>Now I am in my early adult days.. I would'nt say that it's going great
                    but there are a lot of memorable and wonderful memories.
                    I joined a pageant I never planned in my whole life.
                    It went great, it brought me out of my shell, and I am
                    very thankful to all the people that help me on that journey.
                    Because of it, I discovered a lot about myself.
